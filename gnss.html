    <h1>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)</h1>

    <p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems play a pivotal role in providing accurate positioning and navigation
        information across the globe. Here, we explore some of the prominent GNSS systems:</p>

    <h2>1. GPS (Global Positioning System)</h2>

    <p>GPS, developed by the United States Department of Defense, is one of the most widely used GNSS systems. It
        consists of a constellation of satellites in orbit around Earth, providing precise location and timing
        information to GPS receivers.</p>

    <h2>2. Galileo</h2>

    <p>Galileo is the European Union's GNSS system designed to be independent of other navigation systems. It aims to
        provide global coverage and is known for its commitment to civil service, ensuring that users around the world
        have access to accurate positioning information.</p>

    <h2>3. Baidu Navigation Satellite System</h2>

    <p>Developed by China, the Baidu Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is another prominent player in the GNSS arena. It
        provides coverage primarily in the Asia-Pacific region and has both regional and global navigation capabilities,
        enhancing positioning accuracy.</p>

    <h2>4. QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System)</h2>

    <p>QZSS, operated by Japan, is designed to augment GPS services in the Asia-Oceania region. It consists of multiple
        satellites, including quasi-zenith satellites that are positioned in the sky to ensure a more stable signal
        reception, especially in urban areas with tall buildings.</p>

    <h2>5. NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation)</h2>

    <p>NavIC is the regional GNSS system developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It provides accurate
        positioning information over India and the surrounding region. NavIC aims to enhance navigation services in
        diverse sectors, including transportation and disaster management.</p>

    <p>These GNSS systems collectively contribute to the advancement of technologies dependent on accurate positioning,
        including navigation, surveying, and location-based services.</p>
