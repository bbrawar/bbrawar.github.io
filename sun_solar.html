    <h1>The Sun and Solar Phenomena</h1>

    <p>The Sun, a prominent star in our solar system, plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth. It exhibits various
        phenomena that impact space weather and have significant effects on our planet.</p>

    <h2>The Sun's Structure</h2>

    <p>The Sun consists of several layers, including the core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere,
        and corona. Each layer has distinct properties and contributes to the Sun's overall behavior.</p>

    <h2>Solar Wind</h2>

    <p>The Sun constantly releases a stream of charged particles known as solar wind. This continuous outflow affects the
        heliosphere and interacts with the Earth's magnetosphere, influencing space weather conditions.</p>

    <h2>Sunspots</h2>

    <p>Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as darker spots. They are associated with
        intense magnetic activity and can impact solar radiation.</p>

    <h2>Coronal Holes</h2>

    <p>Coronal holes are regions on the Sun with lower density and temperature. They can lead to increased solar wind
        speeds and contribute to geomagnetic storms on Earth.</p>

    <h2>Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)</h2>

    <p>CMEs are massive expulsions of solar plasma and magnetic field into space. When directed toward Earth, they can
        cause geomagnetic disturbances, affecting communication and power systems.</p>

    <h2>Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs)</h2>

    <p>CIRs occur when high-speed solar wind streams interact with slower solar wind regions. They can lead to enhanced
        space weather effects.</p>

    <h2>Solar Flares</h2>

    <p>Solar flares are sudden and intense releases of energy on the Sun's surface. They emit X-rays and ultraviolet
        radiation and can impact Earth's ionosphere and radio communication.</p>
